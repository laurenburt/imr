You glide toward the\n          kitchenette, and say “shower if you will”. The kitchenette comports\n          itself into a bathroom. It took three era’s to implement but when the\n          earth zone’s first biotic plant shelters began to root, it meant the\n          advent of transforming modular homes. Your favorite music begins to\n          play as water gushes from the ceiling. After a much needed shower, you\n          say “wardrobe if you will” and what was once a bathroom area begins to\n          shift into a modest sized closet space. Layers!

You're lucky to have found a room in the south ward.\n          Your complex lays two blocks from the entrance to Naer park, a\n          sprawling centrefold of a biome integrated into Shale city. While most\n          of the city’s building structures are living innovations, deep within\n          residents of Naer park live in the canopy of the great Naer trees,\n          stewards of the local life forms. You glance away from the synaptic\n          reader in your eye lens to take in the flower gardens, fields and Naer\n          lake. The phoenix herons’ amber nests floating atop the marsh at the\n          edge of the lake would glow in the evening. With the flight of the\n          ‘pheorons’, the nests were now a feast for urchin otters, shole’s,\n          umbran grits, and Naer vixens.\n          <br></br>\n          <br></br>*stomach grumbles* Your appreciation for life quickly turns\n          to indignant envy. ‘Oh goddess, so hungry!’ Before you pop a vein, you\n          spot an empty canal covered station stop nearby and duck into it.\n          ‘Oracle, if you will, active mode.’ Your octic clothing changes form,\n          the layered outfit’s cells shift into athletic wear, and your footwear\n          adjusts for optimal first meal chasing. Taking a breath, you start\n          jogging to Hink’s, passing by neighborhood vendors, school children in\n          uniforms, city officials guiding tourists, buskers, Gangreen’s on\n          stoop’s planning their next misadventure. You see Hink’s yellow\n          signage six buildings away, a welcome beacon. Starting to dash, your\n          eyes fixated and nose glued to the wafting smell of Hink’s honey\n          hocks.
