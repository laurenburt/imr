          You manage to get out of bed- as soon as your feet touch the floor you
          undergo a metamorphosis- no longer a hinter sloth, you’re a kirlian
          shadow chaser ready to dash and dine. You glide toward the
          kitchenette, and say “shower if you will”. The kitchenette comports
          itself into a bathroom. It took three era’s to implement but when the
          earth zone’s first biotic plant shelters began to root, it meant the
          advent of transforming modular homes. Your favorite music begins to
          play as water gushes from the ceiling. After a much needed shower, you
          say “wardrobe if you will” and what was once a bathroom area begins to
          shift into a modest sized closet space. Layers! The phoenix herons
          heralded layer season. At last- you’ve been waiting what seems like
          eons to don your favorite jacket.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          You’re afoot. The walk to Hink’s diner is pleasant... It’s noticeably
          chilly outside. Vapors from your breath uncoil as you walk along the
          canal pathway. You're lucky to have found a room in the south ward.
          Your complex lays two blocks from the entrance to Naer park, a
          sprawling centrefold of a biome integrated into Shale city. While most
          of the city’s building structures are living innovations, deep within
          residents of Naer park live in the canopy of the great Naer trees,
          stewards of the local life forms. You glance away from the synaptic
          reader in your eye lens to take in the flower gardens, fields and Naer
          lake. The phoenix herons’ amber nests floating atop the marsh at the
          edge of the lake would glow in the evening. With the flight of the
          ‘pheorons’, the nests were now a feast for urchin otters, shole’s,
          umbran grits, and Naer vixens.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>*stomach grumbles* Your appreciation for life quickly turns
          to indignant envy. ‘Oh goddess, so hungry!’ Before you pop a vein, you
          spot an empty canal covered station stop nearby and duck into it.
          ‘Oracle, if you will, active mode.’ Your octic clothing changes form,
          the layered outfit’s cells shift into athletic wear, and your footwear
          adjusts for optimal first meal chasing. Taking a breath, you start
          jogging to Hink’s, passing by neighborhood vendors, school children in
          uniforms, city officials guiding tourists, buskers, Gangreen’s on
          stoop’s planning their next misadventure. You see Hink’s yellow
          signage six buildings away, a welcome beacon. Starting to dash, your
          eyes fixated and nose glued to the wafting smell of Hink’s honey
          hocks. You're two buildings away, Finally!

          Wafel rolls, your favorite!
          <br></br>
          You begin to set at a breakneck dash hoping you are early in the
          queue. Lines are typical at Rosha's Hot Shot Hotcake Shop. For those
          in the 5th ward, when Rosha's doors open, it signals the beginning of
          the neighborhood's enterprises. As you round the corner of a building
          you duck under a low hanging lattice system.
          <br></br>
          You almost collide into a young Kobo pulling a fruit merchant's
          produce.
          <br></br>
          As you weave your way through the morning commotion you almost nick
          yourself running through circus row, an alley famous for its resident
          performers, their animal compatriots, self-avowed freaks and roving
          mystics. The smell of spices and citrus entice you.
          <br></br>
          {/* <div class="indent1">
            <span class="bold1">???:</span> Look out!
          </div> */}
          "Look out!"
          <br></br>A juggler's throwing knife grazes your cheek. Without
          stopping you apologize, somewhat embarassed, and continue the duck and
          cover dance through the alley.
          <br></br>
          So close to Rosha's, you turn to look behind you, the runner's high
          now rushing from your toes to the base of your neck. You haven't felt
          this excited in a long while...
          <br></br>
          You look ahead and before you can yell, you are about to crash into
          someone holding a tower of Hotcake boxes.
          <br></br>
          You take a tumble forward, your luck having run out.

        right) but surprise surprise, I ran into a little bit of luck traveling
        through the outer zones. This isn’t going to any old housewarming- this
        is going to be a Houseflaming! Please say you’ll come! No worries about
        bringing anything, I’ve got everything taken care of. All you’ve got to
        do is say “yes!” I’ve attached train tickets if you were concerned about
        flying. Air traffic has been hectic around here lately.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Take care old friend and see you soon.

        They knelt in ceremonial fashion before Cat’s nose, creamed head bowed
        toward the canine. With a merry woof, Cat’s pale pink tongue set to
        work, extending, licking and cleaning in lightning succession. Before
        the genetic ban, cleaner dogs were genetically modified to have tongues
        that could extend to great lengths, purify any surface it touched, and
        bodies that were able to process any substance, even high grade
        pollutants. Vanguards of public health, they aided in cleansing toxic
        zones. Their saliva was even said to cure cancers. In a matter of
        moments, Cat’s work was finished. The old dog yipped to signal
        completion and scampered happily back to rest in his bedding below the
        countertop, having had more treats than he was expecting. ‘Creamface’
        rose from his bow. The emerald suit that was stained was now spotless.
        In fact it seemed to shine with a minty luster. Statuesque, as if the
        suit was carved on them, you notice the chiseled and robust features of
        your new acquaintance. They turn toward you, jade iris eyes, a kind
        smile, face carved by the goddesses themselves and all.
