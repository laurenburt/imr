              You glance away from the synaptic reader in your eye lens to take
              in the flower gardens, fields and Naer lake. The phoenix herons’
              amber nests floating atop the marsh at the edge of the lake would
              glow in the evening. With the flight of the pheorons, the nests

              vixens.

            have tongues that could extend to great lengths, purify any surface
