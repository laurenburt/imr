              you're running up against yourself and hitting a bunch of walls.
              When I feel closed up, I get frustrated- that's not cute, not cute
              at all! I have to do somethin-about, so if one way doesn't work
              out, I try another. I call it, 'Em's 1000 Worlds!' Seems like what
              you need is more experiences - what kind I have no idea. Okay, now

              The city lamps of Nuzkaros lights your way like soft stars. You're
              nearing the neighborhood Em lives in via thermal tram. You watch
              all manner of life as the tram moves toward your destination.

            <p>
              Some stray phoenix herons have nested on lampposts, others on the
              roofs of buildings. People in traditional Nuzkari garb walk the
              streets in sandals alongside those wearing the latest Denthalassan
              fashions.{" "}
            </p>

            <p>
              The thermal tram's windowless feature allows you to feel the ether
              rich air, cool at night, yet always warm. Your Sintax guide
              notifies you to get off the next station.

              Alone, you walk toward the corner of the balcony facing the pool
              and deck. Em was always popular- quite the charmer in fact.
              Reluctant to join the party downstairs, you count a dozen guests
              out on the deck and half a dozen more swimming in the infinity
              pool- none of whom you recognize. If you didn't know better, you
              would have mistaken Em's friends for Pipe Gang members... In the

              land barge float, swaying with the light winds. Strange...

              One of the helipads descends. You make out what looks like Agent
              Scuri's silhouette hanging to the side of the helipad. Agent Scuri
              hops off and smoothly lands, takes the first step and trips toward
              you.

              taking on side hustles to help pay for my music lessons. One of
              those jobs happened to be a passion of mine- protecting and
              safeguarding endangered organisms. I've always had a soft spot for
              bio-organisms as a cyborg myself. Busting poachers as a bounty
              hunter seemed like a perfect fit. I'd busk during the day and do
              my own detective work at night. I got so good at it people would
              call me the 'The Poacher Bounty Busker'. Cool, right? Well, my
              streak couldn't last forever. One of those busts didn't turn out
              so well so I quit the business altogether. I originally came to
              Nuzkar to research the glyphs at the foot of the Guardian's
              sanctum about half a year ago. That's when I met Hru, and Gale.

              areas of mystery and maintain functions that promote those founts.
              Sometimes my assignment takes me outside of Shale. In this case,
              it was Nuzkar. I was performing one of my yearly check-ups with
              the Guardian when Hru's bio scan revealed that the Guardians' egg
              had gone missing. Who ever had stolen the egg- must have been
              Nuzkari. Only someone with a deep knowledge of the sanctum, the
              Obsidianites, and the Guardian could infiltrate without notice so
              this theory narrowed down the list of suspects. I'd heard a very
              talented poacher hunter settled in Nuzkar so I tried finding them.
              Turns out this great poacher bounty busker had retired. The
              urgency to recover a future Guardian and my caseload was at an all
              time high so I did the only logical thing to do.
