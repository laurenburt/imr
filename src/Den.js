            </p>
            <p>
              Denthalassa is an archipelago of seafaring islands that travels
              the oceans. Every four years the islands returns to the convening
              point. How the islands were constructed is a mystery. At the Expo,
              you remember overhearing Nix saying in an overly theatrical spooky
              tone how Den was an 'Aaaaancient Puuuuuzzle!'. Each island is
              governed by village elders with a chief. There are four stationary
              islands and 20 traveling islands, each island containing 5 levels.

              On the 0th level, some skies above each island teem with floating
              energy facilities, weather science decks, roosts for migrating
              species and luxury homes. On level 1, the surface features an
              array of wilderness beside villages, farming zones, resort areas
              and highly concentrated urban environments. Each island on
              Denthalassa terraforms according to collective decision, ranging
              from a surface of mostly jungle to one covered in an array of
              entertainments. Beneath level 1 is level 2, the island crust,
              where some residential homes, most storage facilities, training
              grounds, and offices are located. On level 3 are research
              facilities, processing plants, energy grids, schools, and
              underwater cities that are protected by clear barriers made from
              true ether. It is typical for residents to go about their day
              among shoals of fish, whales, and other underwater occurences. Few
              have been said to gain access to level 4 where strict adherence to
              clearances are made- children call it The Phantom Zone, elders
              call it Eternium. If you were to dive beyond level 3 from outside,
              attempting to reach level 4, you would encounter a bounded field,
              preventing access.

              did the jewelry. You were aware of statements that Denthalassan's'

              Terran waves at the automaton attendent. The gate opens and Terran
              steers the hover bike along the path, heading further inland among
              Eha forest until you enter a clearing. The grand estate is as you
              expected- grand.

              Terran parks the hoverbike at the fountain roundabout. A polished

              greets you, and ushers you and Terran in.

              Terran walks the grand hallway, taking a sharp left passing a
              couple guest suites, takes a sharp right passing doors leading to
              what looks like a ballroom and portrait gallery. You struggle to
              keep up with Terran's pace until Terran stops at a front of

              much intensity in the work place. Your professional life had been
              largely one of a series of mundane work culture. Whether it was
              divining which of your coworkers ate your lunch or who was to be

              work place dramas. But this... You rise and make your formal

              present your gifts from Shale to Su and V, much to their pleasant

              tones. You are surprised Nix is capable of smiling at all after
              seeing their 'true' self. You and V provide supporting evidence as

              The hover bike zooms over the lush Eha forest heading back to the

              a bull boar family frolick in a flower field. Now over the beach

              Eha city, the bike enters a controlled descent before a modern
              structure. Instead of walking to the entrance, Terran guides you

              Terran's command of language and financial skill works wonders to

              You realize you can move the forging time up and negotiate the
